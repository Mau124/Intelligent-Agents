Missionaries and Cannibals

Three missionaries and three canibals are on one side of a river, which can be
crossed by a boat that can carry one or two people. The problem is to find a 
way to get all six people across, so that at no time will the number of cannibals
exceed the number of missionaries on eiter side of the river, if there are
missionaries on that side.

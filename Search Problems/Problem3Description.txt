Jar Problem

Imagine that you have three jars with capacities A, B and C liters (integer
numbers ) such as A > B > C and A is even. Initially, the bigger jar is full and
the other two are empty. The goal is to distribute the initial content between
the bigger two jars. For example, for the problem A = 8, B = 5, and C = 3, 
initially there are 8 liters in the jar A, and the rest are empty. Then, at the
end, the jars A and B will have 4 liters each with C empty.
